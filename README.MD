# Huawei Matebook E Go (8cx Gen 3)

This repository contains workarounds for the Huawei Matebook E Go (8cx Gen 3) to support Linux.

This project mainly refers to the following projects:
* [jhovold](https://github.com/jhovold/linux): x13s downstream linux maintainer, upstream support for sc8280xp platform and x13s device.
* [steev](https://github.com/steev/linux): x13s downstream linux maintainer.
* [linaro team](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-pm/cover/20240614-yoga-ec-driver-v7-0-9f0b9b40ae76@linaro.org/): initial arm64 EC support(C630), and UCSI driver based on arm64 EC.
* [Nikita Travkin](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/platform/arm64/acer-aspire1-ec.c): anoter arm64 EC driver.
* [aymanbagabas](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI): Huawei laptop wmi driver.
* [NewWheat](https://gitlab.com/New-Wheat/linux-for-huawei-matebook-e-2019): yet anoter arm64 EC driver, and help from him.
* [chenxuecong2](https://github.com/chenxuecong2/linux-huawei-matebook-e-go) & [matalama80td3l](https://github.com/matalama80td3l/matebook-e-go-boot-works): initial device tree for the Huawei Matebook E Go.

## Altmode

> [!CAUTION]
> Recently, UCSI subsystem is buggy for this tablet. Chances are that failed to boot(auto reboot). Only plug into Type-C ports after booting up.

Addition: UCSI failed to register in 6.14, no sure about future (I don't own this device anymore, no fix from me)

Support 2-lane only for now(only half of clocks are enabled), Johan mentioned [this](https://github.com/jhovold/linux/wiki/X13s#USB) also, but we don't require insert orientation.

In default, the bandwidth of per lane is limited to 5.4Gbps(HBR2, DisplayPort 1.2 or later). If you want to a higher limit, set this.

```
...
&mdss0_dp0_out {
...
        link-frequencies = /bits/ 64 <1620000000 2700000000 5400000000 8100000000>;
...
};
...
```

According to the [dcoument](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/dev-kit/#set-up-display---how-to-connect-monitors) of Windows Dev Kit 2023, USB-C ports support 8.1Gbps per lane(HBR3, DisplayPort 1.3 or later).

In my case, the monitor supports DisplayPort 1.1 with 2.7Gbps per lane, data rate is 4.32Gbps(8b10b coding), basically, it means I can only use 1920x1080@60Hz. However, if we tweak the timings(at your risks), we can support a decent resolution with a rich timings, 24bpp with 2048(+180H.Blanking)x1280(+60V.Blanking)@60hz $\approx$ 4.30Gbps. If the bandwidth limit is exceeded, your bpp will be degraded to 18 (or lower?) to make actual bandwidth under the limit.

If you encounter the following, reboot, it is rare, but still possible.
```
gaokun_ucsi.ucsi gaokun_ec.ucsi.0: error -ETIMEDOUT: PPM init failed
gaokun_ucsi.ucsi gaokun_ec.ucsi.0: con1: failed to register alt modes
```
If there is no issue now, let's plug in wait for seconds.

***Note: if you plug out when there is no other video output device(logical), replug will not work.***

## Audio
Recently, use the X13s' profile. \
`sed -i 's/LENOVO.*ThinkPad X13s.*/LENOVO.*ThinkPad X13s.*|HUAWEI.*MateBook E.*\"/' /usr/share/alsa/ucm2/Qualcomm/sc8280xp/sc8280xp.conf`

## Battery
### Charging control

`echo '72' /sys/class/power_supply/gaokun-ec-battery/smart_charge_delay`

`echo '40' /sys/class/power_supply/gaokun-ec-battery/charge_control_start_threshold`

`echo '70' /sys/class/power_supply/gaokun-ec-battery/charge_control_end_threshold`

`echo '0/1' /sys/class/power_supply/gaokun-ec-battery/battery_adaptive_charge`

That means plugged in after 72 hours, charging level is limited to 70%.

> When the laptop is just connected to a power adapter, it starts charging until the battery level reaches 70% if the battery level is lower than 70%, or the battery level does not increase if the battery level is 70% or higher. This is normal.

> When the power adapter is always connected, the laptop starts charging if its battery level is lower than 40%, and stops charging when the battery level reaches 70%.

Further explanation, check Huawei support [page](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us15783714/)

The values would not be saved after you shut down and plugged out, you can use `udev` to set the default values, like
```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", KERNEL=="gaokun-ec-battery", ATTR{smart_charge_delay}="0", ATTRS{charge_control_start_threshold}="45", ATTRS{charge_control_end_threshold}="50", ATTRS{battery_adaptive_charge}="1"
```

## Camera
* front camera sensor: hi846(cci2, gpio12: cci_i2c_sda, gpio13: cci_i2c_scl, CAMCC_MCLK3_CLK: 24MHz, gpio17, reset: gpio15)
* rear camera sensor: s5k3l6(cci1, gpio10: cci_i2c_sda, gpio11: cci_i2c_scl, CAMCC_MCLK4_CLK: 24MHz, gpio6, reset: gpio7)

Front sensor can be probed, no camera video.

The rear sensor can't be detected.

## Display
The main problem is baclkight, resetting panel causes backlight hardware to shutdown.
DSC with video mode is another problem, but I believe this won't causes a truly black screen.

gpio(0,1,8,20,24,52,53,...): gpio0 is backlight enable pin, gpioset -c 4 0=1/0, backlight turn on/off, gpio 52. 53, (vddp, vddn), more infomation, check [here](panel-hx83121a-dkms/dsi_pwr_seq.txt).

**Addition: Some patches are first proposed by [matalama80td3l](https://github.com/matalama80td3l) at [here](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm/-/issues/56). I verified and completed them.**

## FN Lock
`echo 0/1 > /sys/devices/platform/soc@0/ac0000.geniqup/a9c000.i2c/i2c-15/15-0038/fn_lock` \
`0`: disable the fn key(hotkey first, such as press `F1` to decrease brightness) \
`1`: enable the fn key(function key first), you can only trigger hotkey with `Fn + F1-12` \
BTW, you can press `Fn` key(light on) to reverse it temporarily.

## Thermal Sensors from EC
I don't know these sensors for which devices, but you can read them \
`sensors`
```
gaokun_ec_hwmon-i2c-15-38
Adapter: Geni-I2C
temp1:        +47.4°C
...
temp20:       +25.9°C
```

## SLPI
SLPI(Sensor Low Power Island), [more details](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-devicetree/20230406173148.28309-1-me@dylanvanassche.be/).
```
[    2.606897] remoteproc remoteproc2: remote processor 2400000.remoteproc is now up
[    2.613505] qcom,fastrpc 2400000.remoteproc:glink-edge.fastrpcglink-apps-dsp.-1.-1: no reserved DMA memory for FASTRPC
```
No `IOMMU`, The firmware of slpi can be loaded, you can also find `/dev/fastrpc-sdsp`, but the DT in my patch is wrong, sensors won't work.

## Video acceleration
The firmware can be loaded. It supports v4l2_m2m, never tested it.

## Wi-Fi
Use [the script](https://github.com/qca/qca-swiss-army-knife/blob/master/tools/scripts/ath11k/ath11k-bdencoder),

extract all files from the board file[(remote one)](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/ath11k/WCN6855/hw2.0/board-2.bin),

```
./ath11k-bdencoder -e board-2.bin
```

edit `board-2.json`, let us use x13s one calibration data,

```
...
"board": [
...
            {
                "names": [
                    "bus=pci,vendor=17cb,device=1103,subsystem-vendor=17cb,subsystem-device=0108,qmi-chip-id=2,qmi-board-id=255,variant=HW_GK3"
                ],
                "data": "bus=pci,vendor=17cb,device=1103,subsystem-vendor=17cb,subsystem-device=0108,qmi-chip-id=2,qmi-board-id=140,variant=LE_X13S.bin"
            },
...
]
...
```

regenerate it,

```
./ath11k-bdencoder -c board-2.json
```
